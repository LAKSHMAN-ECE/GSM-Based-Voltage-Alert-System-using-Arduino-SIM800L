# GSM-Based-Voltage-Alert-System-using-Arduino-SIM800L
This project monitors voltage using a potentiometer connected to an Arduino. When the voltage reaches 4.8V or higher, the system automatically sends an SMS and makes a phone call using the SIM800L GSM module. This is useful for voltage-based alert systems like power monitoring, battery protection, or trigger-based alerts.
